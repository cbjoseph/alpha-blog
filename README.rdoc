Alpha Blog!
This is a simple blog app. Users can sign-up and create/edit/delete their own articles.
Administrators have access to create categories and manage users.
The login feature uses sessions.

Shoutout to loremricksum.com for being a fun Rick and Morty themed lorem ipsum generator.

If you'd like to add a profile picture, create an account on gravatar.com with the email you used to sign-up for the Alpha Blog. Needs to be a real email address so that they can verify you.
